## Title : Neuromorphic associative memories

### Abstract

Mathematical artificial neural network models known as associative memories first developed over 60 years ago worked by storing patterns of information via changes in the strengths of connections between simple computing units that mimicked the operation of neurons in the brain in a very simple way. Old memories were recalled when a noisy or partial version of a previously stored patterns was presented to the network. However, these devices were not very flexible. They had to be told when to store a pattern and when they were supposed to recall a memory. The types of information they could store were quite limited.

I will present more flexible brain-inspired models of associative memory that control by themselves the storage and recall of patterns of information arriving at unpredictable rates. The models' connectomes will based upon the many details we know about the neuronal hippocampal circuit, a part of the brain that acts as a short-term memory. The models comprise of different cellular components and oscillate at different clock frequencies. I will show results of how their recall performances vary as a function of stored patterns, pattern interference, contexts, network size, and engram cells when specific synaptic connections in them are strengthened.

The implications of these works would help in developing strategies for preventing memory loss, an ailment of aging.
