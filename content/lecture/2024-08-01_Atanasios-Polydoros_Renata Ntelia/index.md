## Dr. Atanasios Polydoros

### Short Bio

Dr. Athanasios Polydoros is a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln, member of the Lincoln Centre of Autonomous Systems and supervisor within the Centre of Doctoral Training in Agri-Food Robotics . Before that he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) and the University of Innsbruck. He holds a M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and A Dip. Eng. In Production Engineering from Democritus University of Thrace. His research interests include robot learning from demonstration, machine learning and robot control. He has multiple publications in high-impact conferences and journals in the field and has participated in EU and nationally funded projects. 

### Presentation Title: Robot Learning from visual demonstrations  

#### Abstract

An increased research interest on learning from demonstration methods has been observed over the last years due to their advantages such as the ease to introduce tasks from non-experts and the transferability and adaptability that those methods introduce in robotic systems. Although there exists multiple methods for introducing demonstrations, robot learning from videos is the easiest for users but it comes with multiple challenges for the developers. In this presentation, I will introduce the concept of learning from demonstrations and focus on the advantages and challenges of learning from videos of humans.

## Dr. Renata Ntelia

### Short Bio

Renata Ntelia is an Assistant Professor with the School of Computer Science, University of Lincoln. She holds a PhD from the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta. Her research focus is on Games and HCI. She has also published and worked on gamification projects.

### Presentation Title:  Games and Computer Vision for Playing and Learning

#### Abstract

In this presentation, I will be covering three topics. I will begin with talking about my main research focus, which is love in games within the context of human-computer interaction (HCI). My main research question is whether human players can fall in love with computer-generated characters. This line of research has connotations for player experience regarding in particular mental health but it can find applications in HCI in general as well as AI, for example in robot companions. My second point will cover my past and current projects regarding game design and gamification, namely an AR project about Maltese history and culture and a WW2 educational game employing procedural content generation and machine learning as tools for digital preservation of historical trauma. Finally, my presentation will focus on game design and gamification in synergies with control systems and computer vision. Games have used vision in multiple ways to engage players, e.g. by eye tracking and facial expressions. This collaboration between user design and computer vision is especially pertinent when it comes to affective computing, in which feelings and emotions, love included, are a focus point of the user experience. Computer vision and games/gamification can also be used in the context of collecting data to train models as well as for learning applications about computer vision.
