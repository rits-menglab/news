## [Prof. GAO Weinan / Northeastern University, China](https://weinangao.github.io/)

### Biography

Weinan Gao received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA. He is a Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries at Northeastern University, Shenyang, China. Previously, he was an Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Civil Engineering at Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, USA, an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA, USA, and a Visiting Professor of Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA. His research interests include reinforcement learning, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), optimal control, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), intelligent transportation systems, sampled-data control systems, and output regulation theory. Prof. Gao is the recipient of the best paper award in IEEE Data Driven Control and Learning Systems (DDCLS) Conference in 2023, IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR) in 2018 and the David Goodman Research Award at New York University in 2019. He is an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, Control Engineering Practice, Neurocomputing and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, a member of Editorial Board of Neural Computing and Applications, and a Technical Committee member in IEEE Control Systems Society on Nonlinear Systems and Control, IFAC TC 1.2 Adaptive and Learning Systems, and CAAI Industrial Artificial Intelligence.

### Title: Reinforcement Learning and Intelligent Control: Theory and Applications

#### Abstract

Reinforcement learning concerns how an agent interacts with unknown or uncertain environment to minimize the cumulative cost. Reinforcement learning and intelligent control techniques have been combined to develop adaptive optimal controllers for dynamic systems. In this talk, I will discuss how to leverage RL and intelligent control as efficient tools to address complex control problems, including output regulation, cooperative control, and output-feedback control. Practical examples involve power systems and intelligent connected vehicles.
